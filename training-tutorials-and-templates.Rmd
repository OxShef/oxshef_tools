**OxShef: Tools** cannot be a complete overview of all visualisation tools available, nor can we maintain a complete overview of training and templates available for the dataviz tools that meet our [reproducible dataviz workflow criteria](reproducible-dataviz-workflow.html). However, you might find these resources generally useful:

- [Awesome Lists (Data Viz)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome): This is a crowd sourced collection of resources about data visualisation tools, tutorials and other resources. It's maintained via GitHub, so anyone can contribute.

- [Lynda.com](Lynda.com): Subscription learning service with courses on a wide variety of dataviz tools, many Universities provide access to Lynda.com for free. Contact your local research support teams for support.

- [Datacamp.com](datacamp.com): Subscription learning service with courses on a variety of dataviz tools.
